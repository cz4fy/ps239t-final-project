# ps239t-final-project
For Urban Ecological Design Studio that Iâ€™m in, my final design project is to address the question of how Sea Level Rise can create opportunities for better social equity around Lake Merritt. One of the research questions that I am exploring is whether park amenities and programming around Lake Merritt provides equal access to all users. From the research so far it seems that park amenities and programming occur more on the north side of the lake rather than the south, and therefore attracts more users to the north side of the lake, which is already a more affluent community. In order to create a fairer park, my design proposal involves creating more park amenities and engaging stakeholders on the south side of the lake.   To test the hypothesis that an indicator of a user enjoying the park amenities is when they post photo on Instagram of the lake and surroundings. The plan is to: web-scrape instagram API to get geolocations of pictures taken around the lake within a small distance geocode these points with R map the points either with R or GIS (depending on how far I can get with mapping in R)
